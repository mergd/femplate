## Getting Started

This is a guide to get you started with [mergd/femplate](https://github.com/mergd/femplate).

### Installing

Click [`use this template`](https://github.com/mergd/femplate/generate) to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

Or, if your repo already exists, run:

```sh
forge init --template https://github.com/mergd/femplate
git submodule update --init --recursive
forge install

```

### Testing:

There's Smock installed on this repo, you can generate mocks for your contracts with:

```sh

yarn smock-foundry --contracts src/
```

Additional docs [here](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/smock-foundry)

Run `./utils/rename.sh` to rename all instances of `femplate` with the name of your project/repository.

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:

```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰

Run `yarn install` to install Wagmi and the Smock testing library.

View the [Wagmi Docs](https://wagmi.sh/cli/plugins/foundry) to learn more about how the Typescript bindings work.

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), all tests are written in Solidity! ðŸ¥³

Create a test file for your contract in the `test/` directory.

For example, [`src/Greeter.sol`](./src/Greeter.sol) has its test file defined in [`./test/Greeter.t.sol`](./test/Greeter.t.sol).

To learn more about writing tests in Solidity for Foundry, reference Rari Capital's [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/tree/main/src/test) repository created by [@transmissions11](https://twitter.com/transmissions11).

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).

### That's it!
